# NumericalControllability

This repostory is designed for my master thesis. The algorithms presented here are based on the ones found in Boyer, F. (2013, December). On the penalised HUM approach and its applications to the numerical approximation of null-controls for parabolic problems. In ESAIM: Proceedings (Vol. 41, pp. 15-58). EDP Sciences.
and in the seminar work Carthel, C., Glowinski, R., & Lions, J. C. L. U. (1994). On exact and approximate boundary controllabilities for the heat equation: a numerical approach. Journal of optimization theory and applications, 82(3), 429-484.

We finally compare the robustness of the HUM approach compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms to compute null controls for parabolic equations.
